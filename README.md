Overview:

DeLaw introduces a decentralized legal arbitration protocol designed to address the limitations of smart contracts by integrating a trusted Oracle system for subjective data interpretation. This innovative protocol merges blockchain's immutability with traditional legal mechanisms, offering a streamlined and cost-effective alternative to conventional dispute resolution methods.

Features:

Decentralized Arbitration: Leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent framework for resolving disputes.
Trusted Oracles: Incorporates a reliable Oracle system to evaluate and interpret subjective, real-world data essential for complex decision-making processes.
Stake-based Incentives: Ensures accountability and fairness in the arbitration process through stake-based incentives and transparent arbitrator selection.
Wide Application Range: Supports a variety of use cases, from customer service and insurance claims to real estate transactions and contract disputes.
Scalable and Accessible: Designed to enhance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functionalities, making it adaptable to a broad spectrum of applications.
Future Expansion: Plans for incorporating broader contract types, decentralized identity, credentialing, and a DAO for protocol governance.

Stack: 

This protocol and solidity contracts are initialized with hardhat.
